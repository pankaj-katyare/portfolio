                        <li><strong>Circles.Life Experience:</strong> At Circles.Life, I was part of a dynamic team working on a cutting-edge system built on a microservices-based service mesh architecture. Our deployment was on Kubernetes, utilizing Istio for efficient management. The services within our architecture communicated securely through mutual TLS and gRPC, ensuring robust and secure data exchanges.

                          One of my primary responsibilities was managing third-party API throttling. We achieved this using GCP Cloud Tasks to queue tasks, with Cloud Functions written in GoLang handling the processing. This setup ensured we could manage high volumes of requests efficiently and maintain smooth operation even under heavy load.                          
                          For asynchronous inter-service communication, we leveraged GCP PubSub. This choice allowed us to decouple our services, improve scalability, and handle message queues effectively. On the frontend, we developed our applications using React.JS, where I employed Recoil for state management to maintain a seamless user experience. We also integrated WebSocket for real-time notifications, enhancing the responsiveness of our applications.    
                          Our tech stack was diverse and powerful, including GoLang for backend services, Angular Firebase auth for secure authentication, and AWS Kubernetes Engine for deployment. We used PostgreSQL for our relational database needs and MongoDB for handling more dynamic data structures. For monitoring and performance tracking, we integrated newRelic, ensuring we could promptly address any issues that arose.
                          Working at Circles.Life allowed me to hone my skills in microservices, secure communications, cloud-based task management, and real-time frontend development, all within a highly collaborative and innovative environment..</li>

                    <p>At Wiz Freight, I was part of a team that developed a digital freight forwarding platform aimed at revolutionizing modern-day logistics. Our platform was designed to help clients book, track, and manage shipments efficiently. It featured comprehensive shipping task management, cargo tracking and insurance, full and partial container load shipping, and customs clearance support, making cargo shipping efficient, hassle-free, and transparent for businesses.
                      My primary responsibility was building a highly scalable backend capable of handling all shipments and their tracking. I utilized GoLang services and gRPC to create robust APIs for various functionalities. These APIs were built with a microservices architecture, allowing us to manage and manipulate data efficiently using a PostgreSQL database, hosted on the cloud for enhanced scalability and reliability.    
                      The technical stack I worked with included GoLang for backend development, gRPC for communication between services, and Angular for frontend development. We deployed our services on AWS cloud infrastructure, leveraging Kubernetes for orchestration and management of our microservices. PostgreSQL was used as our primary database, providing reliable and efficient data storage and retrieval.                    
                      This experience at Wiz Freight allowed me to develop expertise in building scalable backend systems, creating and managing APIs, and working with a comprehensive microservices architecture. It also enhanced my skills in using cloud-based infrastructure and deploying applications using Kubernetes, contributing to a seamless and efficient digital freight forwarding platform.</p>

                  <h3>Persistent Systems Experience</h3>
                  <p><strong>2020 -  2022</strong></p>
                  <p>At the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), I was involved in an innovative project aimed at processing vast amounts of astronomy data to create images used by astronomy professors and scientists for their research and analysis. This project was crucial in transforming raw UV data into near science-ready images and catalogs, which were then publicly released for broader scientific use.
                    The project involved the development and management of an automated pipeline to handle a significant fraction of the continuum data in the GMRT archive. This pipeline was designed to process data efficiently, ensuring that a large number of high-quality images and catalogs were produced and made available to the scientific community.                   
                    My responsibilities included managing API functions using GoLang, ensuring that the APIs were robust and efficient for data processing needs. I also managed microservices, ensuring they were seamlessly integrated and functioned effectively within the pipeline. Handling Kubernetes pods was another critical aspect of my role, where I ensured that the deployment and orchestration of services were done efficiently. Additionally, I was involved in creating and managing databases to store and retrieve processed data, ensuring data integrity and availability.                   
                    The technical stack for this project included GoLang for backend development, ensuring efficient processing and management of data. We utilized REST APIs for communication between services and data handling. SQL was used for database management, ensuring that data was stored and retrieved efficiently. The project also involved working with HTTP protocols for data transmission and Angular for frontend development, providing a user-friendly interface for accessing and visualizing processed data. Additionally, Python was used for scripting and automation tasks within the pipeline.               
                    Working on the GMRT Data Archival Processing Pipeline allowed me to refine my skills in API management, microservices, and Kubernetes, as well as gain experience in handling large-scale data processing projects. It was a challenging and rewarding experience that contributed significantly to the scientific community by providing high-quality data and images for future research and analysis.
